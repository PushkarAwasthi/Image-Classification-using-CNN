# Image-Classification-using-CNN
•	Loaded cifar10 Dataset consisting of 60000 32 X 32 color images in 10 classes from tensor flow library having various objects like ship, frog, cat, horse etc.

•	Splitted the data in training and testing with 50000 & 10000 samples respectively and the Normalized our data.

•	Builded ANN with 5 epochs having relu and softmax as an activation function giving accuracy at around 49%.

•	Modeled CNN having 10 epochs and using convolution & max pooling layer with relu and softmax as an activation function giving accuracy around 70% which is a significant improvement over ANN.
